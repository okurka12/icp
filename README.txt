Robot simulator with graphical visualisation and controls.

# Dependencies and prerequisites

The application was developed on Windows 11 23H2 using Qt 5.12.2 along with
the MinGW toolchain, which was a part of the Qt installation.

The application was partially tested on CentOS 7 Linux using Qt 5.9.7
(shool server merlin).

Makefile for the actual build is generated by qmake. Included Makefile is
a wrapper for both qmake and the generated Makefile.

# Build process

make         - build the application
make run     - build and launch the application
make doxygen - generate doxygen documentation
make clean   - remove all generated files
make pack    - zip necessary files

# About the application

Initially, there is an empty grid with no robots. Obstacles can be drawn with
by clicking left mouse button on the grid. Obstacles can be loaded from
file icp_obstacles.txt, where there are x, y coordinates for each obstacle.
There is one obstacle per line (see examples/icp_obstacles.txt). The current
obstacle list can be saved to the same file (overwriting it). The coordinates
are grid coordinates, not pixel coordinates.

Note: to use examples/icp_obstacles.txt, you need to copy icp_obstacles.txt
to the same directory that the executable is run from. When running make run
from the root directory, this is done for you.

Robots can be spawned with buttons or keyboard shortcuts (see Controls
section). Autonomous robots are represented with gray circles, whereas the
controlled robot is a white circle. Note there can be at most one controlled
robot.

# Controls

Spawn autonomous robot     - S
Spawn controlled robot     - C
Pause/unpause simulation   - P, Esc
Load obstacles from a file - O
Save obstacles to a file   - U
Close application          - Ctrl + W

# Controls for the controlled robot

Go forward          - I
Go backward         - K
Rotate to the left  - J
Rotate to the right - L
